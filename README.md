Fist of all, there 2 directories named,
- react_project
- Webprogramming-Service

You need to install the dependencies of the react project
(for the module list, we provided it already.)

$ cd react_project
$ npm i

and for the web service

$ cd ..
$ cd Webprogramming-Service
$ npm i

then you should to run the web service first,

$ cd react_project
$ npm start

and after that go to run the react project

$ cd ..
$ npm start

(!) Btw, the react will asked you it have a same running port. then press Y for run
	React will change port to 3001.

After you run the react project and they show a properly like a example.

And you can pick some Email/Password for login on itcs212_phase_2.sql

If you insert the correct Email/Password on Login page (example: https://prnt.sc/-qGGGTCbShQq)
If not the alert box will come up (example: https://prnt.sc/bensdEG66Zb-)

For search box you can insert only the string A-Za-z0-9,
